# Storing Data with JSON and SQLite

## Description

In this lab you will learn how to store scraped data in two different ways: JSON and SQLite. This will require you to use methods from the [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html), [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), and [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) libraries in Python. If you have selenium installed, no other library installations are required.
